# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
Lesson 3 writing prompts.


Objects 
Properties 
Methods 
for in loop 
Dot notation vs bracket notation 

<b>Objects</b>, like arrays are variables that can hold the data of many other variables.  Unlike arrays Objects allow you to store the values with a property name. Technically arrays are objects too.

<b>Properties</b>- Objects are groups of properties, properties hold the values within an object.

<b>Methods</b>, are what functions (a block of code) within a property (within an object) is referred to as.  Methods can be ran by referring to their position (property) within their object.

<b>For/in</b> loop - will loop through all of the properties of an object.

<b>Dot notation vs bracket notation</b>,  inside a for/in loop you must use dot notation  or the loop will look for a property with that exact name. Bracket notation allows you to include characters that you can not use with dot notation ("",[] etc) and allows you to refer to a property using variables..  Dot notation is preferred when possible because it is easier to read.





2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
